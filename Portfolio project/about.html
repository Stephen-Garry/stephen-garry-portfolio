        <h2>Professional Background</h2>
        <p>I have 4 years of experience in web development, working with a variety of technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. I’ve had the pleasure of collaborating on projects that challenge my skills and allow me to grow.</p>

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>My journey into web development began in secondary school, fueled by a fascination with technology and a desire to create. Inspired by tech enthusiasts, I decided to invest my savings from my allowance to buy my first computer. This choice led me to switch from boarding to day school, allowing me to immerse myself in design.</p>
        
        <p>During this time, I met a pastor who introduced me to the world of Bitcoin. Sharing my passion for computers, he encouraged me to explore the differences between web design and software development. After researching both fields, I discovered my true passion for web development.</p>
        
        <p>With his support, I enrolled in Angela Yu's Full Stack Development course on Udemy, which set me on my path as a developer. Since then, I’ve continually honed my skills.</p>
        
        <p>I’ve also collaborated with talented developers on Discord, taking on projects for the experience rather than financial gain. This hands-on approach has solidified my expertise in HTML, CSS, responsive design, and JavaScript, and I’m excited to keep learning and growing in this dynamic field.</p>
